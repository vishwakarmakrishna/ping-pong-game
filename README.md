# Ping Pong Game

## Features

- Two rods that move together using the 'a' and 'd' keys.
- The game starts with a delay, displaying a countdown timer before the ball starts moving.
- High score tracking stored in local storage.
- Rematch button to start a new game after the current game ends.
- Real-time score display for both the current game and the high score.
- Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
